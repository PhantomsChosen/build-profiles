## Overview
This is a really fun build, especially in Gambit. You spend all your time punching and dodging while the Liar's Handshake perk keeps you alive against most anything.

The core of this build is very light, so it has many options for weapons and mods depending on what you'd like to do.

This build is easy to pick up - the hardest part is making sure you
always have stacks of Combination Blow and not getting dizzy while you
dodge around like a kitten on amphetamines.

### Subclass

Arcstrider - Way of the Warrior with Gambler's Dodge

### Stat Requirements
You have complete flexibility with stats here. The entire combat loop is
handled by abilities and your shotgun. Healing/regen come from Liar's Handshake and
Combat Flow.

* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.
## Exotic Gear
`Armor` - Liar's Handshake

### Armor Mods
You have a lot of options here since your core gameplay loop is handled
with just exotic armor, Gambler's Dodge and a One-Two Punch shotgun

* [Thunder Coil Artifact Mod](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Thunder_Coil)
    * If this ever comes back as an artifact mod it makes this build one of the highest-damage in the game
* Here is a good starting point for group activities that creates a ton
of orbs for your teammates
    * 2x Hands-On - turns punches into supers
    * 2x Distribution - turns dodges in to abilities
    * 2x Melee Damage Resistance - keeps you alive while punching
    * 2x Impact Induction - turns punches into grenades
    * 1x Striking Light - create an orb for your teammates on each powered melee kill when you're Charged With Light
    * 1x Melee Wellmaker - drop an arc well on each powered melee
    * 1x Elemental Charge - get 2x Charged With Light for each arc well
    * 1x Well of Ions - get the occasional melee damage boost
    * 1x Shotgun Scavenger - gotta have shells for One-Two Punch
    * 1x Recuperation - adds a little extra health on the margins
    * 1x Seeking Wells - pick up wells a little easier since you're dodging all the time
* Options
    * Want more super? Add a Font of Wisdom
    * Want more heavy? Add 2x Ammo Finder and a Scavenger
    * Want to run double shotguns or a shotgun and a fusion rifle and
    never run out of ammo? Add a Heavy Handed mod

### Weapons
* Any shotgun with [One-Two Punch](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2679249093/one-two-punch/)
    * Full Choke makes it much easier to hit all your pellets and activate One-Two Punch
    * [Grave Robber](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1631667848/grave-robber/) is great because you never have to reload
    * A lightweight frame gives a convenient mobility boost
    * One-Two punch is rare on Kinetic shotguns and none currently roll with Grave Robber
    * The Deicide is a good option in Gambit as it's Void and will deal with the shields on Envoys
* Scout rifles and bows are good for dealing with ranged enemies and picking at Gambit invaders
* Power Weapons
    * Punching is your main DPS, so you have more than usual flexibility when choosing a Power weapon
    * Tractor Cannon adds a debuff that makes your punches hit even harder

## How It Works
### Combat Loop
1. Punch a baddie to death with a powered melee to add a stack of Combination Blow and activate Combat Flow, which recharges your dodge
1. Dodge to activate Gambler's Dodge, which recharges your melee
1. If the baddie has a lot of health, hit it with your shotgun to activate One-Two Punch and punch it more
1. Repeat

The goal is to have Combination Blow x3 up as much as possible. Each stack of Combination blow gives a +60% damage buff to your melee

Every other melee will activate Liar's Handshake Cross Counter perk which gives a 3x damage bonus to your melee and heals you a small amount when it connects. Cross Counter also will activate after you are melee'd by a baddie

### Using One-Two Punch
* All pellets from your shotgun blast must connect to activate
* After activation, you have time for two melee attacks
* For a beefy baddie, the pattern is: *shoot* *punch* *punch* *shoot* *punch* *punch*
* If you want to go crazy with this, it may be possible to run two
    shotguns and stack One-Two Punch. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH1JG-3lHyc) demonstrates it but the now-defunct quickdraw glitch may be required

### Survivability
* You're vulnerable to ranged enemies. Be especially cautious of turrets that have locked on to you
* Be cautious in groups with multiple yellow-bars. Even though you heal with every other punch, they can still kill you. Prioritize the targets that are hurting you the most
* In groups, use your dodge to get behind enemies or cover. Your melee has extra range in this subclass so you can get back into the fray easily
* Powered melee kills trigger health regeneration, so use that to your advantage
