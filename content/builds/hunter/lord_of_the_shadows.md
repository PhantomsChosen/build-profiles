## Overview
Turn yourself and your fireteam into invisible stat-monsters and throw a bunch of grenades in the process.

### Subclass: 
[Way of the Pathfinder](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Way_of_the_Pathfinder) with [Spike Grenade](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Spike_Grenade)

### Stat Requirements
Strength is top priority here so you can throw smokes as often as possible. 

Your resilience really doesn't need to go past 32 for this build. Using your smoke will give you one stack of Heart of the Pack (**HotP**) for each player that you make invisible up to 3 stacks (including yourself). Each stack of HotP will give you 34 resilience. This means that with a base resilience of 32, making yourself and one other person invisible will bump your resilience up to 100.

Mobility and recovery are are also buffed by HotP but should still be high for when you moments when you don't have HotP active. A good baseline of discipline will pair nicely with the flow of this build too.
``` 
Mobility   : 80+
Resilience : ~32
Recovery   : 80+
Discipline : 30+
Intellect  : -
Strength   : 90+
```
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

### Armor
[Omnioculous](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1935198785/omnioculus/) will be the star of this build. It'll let you hold two smoke charges, return a ton of melee energy when used on teammates, and give a damage resistance buff to everyone affected. 

### Armor Mods
Incorporating these mods isn't required but will make your ability rotation way smoother.
* [Melee Kickstart](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1371877916/melee-kickstart/) (stasis arms)
* [Utility Kickstart](https://www.light.gg/db/items/445559589/utility-kickstart/) (stasis class item)

### Weapons
Nothing is really required here but weapons with [Surplus](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3436462433/surplus/) will really shine with this build, since you'll almost always have an ability charged. Omnioculous also lets you hold two smoke charges, which both count towards Surplus's stacking effects.

[Wellspring](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3592538738/wellspring/) and [Demolitionist](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523296417/demolitionist/) are also solid perks to look for if you really want to lean into the ability loop.

## How It Works
Essentially, you're going to be using your smoke grenade to buff yourself and team with invisibility, damage resistance, and HotP as often as possible with near-constant uptime.

1. Make yourself and at least one teammate invisible using a smoke grenade. This will return about 80% of your melee charge and a good chunk of grenade energy if you've already spent your grenade.
   * Making yourself and two others invisible will give back a full melee charge.
2. Everyone affected will receive a damage resistance buff, allowing you to enter your next engagement more securely.  
3. Using your smokes more often will let you throw grenades more often. Dealing damage with your grenade will also return additional melee energy in case you don't get a full return from casting smokes.
4. Repeat this loop and let the hate-mail flow in.
