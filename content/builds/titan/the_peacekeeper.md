## Overview
PvP build using Peacekeepers with Dual-SMG. This is also an effective build to run with a single SMG and another weapon archetype like a sniper or scout rifle.  

### Subclass:
This build is class-neutral but pairs very well with [Code of the Juggernaut](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Juggernaut) and [Code of the Seigebreaker](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Siegebreaker).

### Stat Priority
Tier 6 resilience and tier 9 recovery are generally the standard for survivability and regeneration time. The other stats are user preference.
``` 
Mobility   : Any
Resilience : 60
Recovery   : 90
Discipline : any
Intellect  : any
Strength   : any
```

### Armor
[Peacekeepers](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3539357319/peacekeepers/) are required for this build. They give a massive amount of benefits but only **while holding an SMG**. The benefits are as follows:
  * Instant ready speed for SMGs
  * Increased handling for all SMG
  * Autoloading holster for stowed SMGs
  * Increased sprint speed while holding an SMG
  * Increased mobility, which improves strafe speed along with jump speed/height (equal to 5 tiers of mobility).

### Armor Mods
No specific armor mods are needed for this build so you can focus on getting your base stats situated and then look into adding some basic combat mods like [Taking Charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3632726238/taking-charge/) and [High Energy Fire](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3632726237/high-energy-fire/).

### Weapons
SMGs with high range and zoom are preferred for effectiveness at further ranges. 
* A well-rolled [Multimach CCX](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3717177717?s=663495154,3142289711,2450788523,591790007,2697220197,0) with high range is ideal for your kinetic slot. [Escape Velocity](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1786797708?s=663495154,3142289711,1866048759,706527188,2697220197,0) is a solid alternative.
* [Shayura's Wrath](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/4023807721?s=3250034553,3142289711,588594999,438098033,2697220197,3789184904) is a easily the best option for the energy slot with [Borrowed Time](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/875848769?s=3250034553,1885400500,2846385770,1890422124,2697220197,0) as another good choice. Shayura's can also roll with [Harmony](https://www.light.gg/db/items/438098033/harmony/), which is perfect to follow up with after a kill with your kinetic.

## How it works
This one is pretty straight-forward. Shoot things, move around quickly, and shoot more things. 

It promotes a pretty close-quarters and mobile playstyle, therefore benefitting from a subclass with more cqc/melee utility, like a Juggernaut striker. The mobility and sprint buffs will also be helpful for disengaging or strafing in 1v1s.

Running daul-SMG's, you never have to reload again. Just swap weapons every time you empty a mag and you can keep shredding through your enemies. This should make it easier to move from engagement to engagement.

The only issue you *may* run into with daul-SMGs is long range engagements. For larger maps, I'd recommend keeping a scout, pulse or sniper on hand to pair with one of your SMGs.
