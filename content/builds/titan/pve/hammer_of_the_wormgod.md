## Subclass:
Code of the Devastator

## Stat Requirements
A good baseline of strength and discipline are nice to kickstart [Roaring Flames] and get your hammer back if you lose it.
``` 
Mobility   : -
Resilience : -
Recovery   : 90
Discipline : 50+
Intellect  : -
Strength   : 50+
```
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

## Exotic Gear
`Armor` - [Wormgod Caress](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1734844651/wormgod-caress/) will give you the highest possible damage output witha stacking buff. [Synthoceps](https://www.light.gg/db/items/241462142/synthoceps/) are not as powerful but provide a very consistent buff that's easier to manage.

`Weapon` - [Tractor Cannon](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3580904581/tractor-cannon/) will fill your heavy slot and let you stack its debuff with One-Two Punch for absurd damage.

## Armor Mods
These mods are optional but they add a lot of utility and survivability.
* [Elemental charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3730619869/elemental-charge/)
* [Melee Wellmaker](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4213142382/melee-wellmaker/)
* [Striking Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1484685885/striking-light/) (arc)
* [Well of life](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2164090163/well-of-life/) (solar)
* [Protective Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523075120/protective-light/) (void)
* [Shotgun Ammo finder](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4148827738/shotgun-ammo-finder/) + [Shotgun Scavenger](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3836152936/shotgun-scavenger/)
* [Impact Induction](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3470562293/impact-induction/)

## Weapons
A shotgun with "One-Two Punch" and full choke is critical to this build. 
* [One Small Step](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1016668089?s=1047830412,106909392,3161816588,2679249093,758092021,0) is an easily-farmable kinetic option.
* World drops and focusing umbrals can also drop a good [The Deicide](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/217140611?s=1047830412,106909392,3161816588,2679249093,758092021,0) for your energy slot.
* Consider running a primary weapon with [Wellspring](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3592538738/wellspring/) if you lose your hammer a lot.

## How It Works
You'll barely use your primary, and killing things exclusively with your throwing hammer and sometimes shotguns. 

With Roaring Flames, solar ability kills increase your solar ability damage (~3 stacks). Wormgods Caress will ramp up your melee damage with every melee kill (~5 stacks). You can amplify melee damage even further by debuffing your enemy with Tractor Cannon, or activating One-Two punch before the melee. These all stack together to let you erase enemies from existence in a single blow.

Here's how the mods work together:
1. When you get a kill with your throwing hammer, [Melee Wellmaker](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4213142382/melee-wellmaker/) makes a solar well of light.
2. When you pick up the well, [Elemental charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3730619869/elemental-charge/) gives you 2x Charged with Light and [Well of life](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2164090163/well-of-life/) gives you steady health regen, even while taking damage.
3. [Striking Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1484685885/striking-light/) makes an orb of power for your allies on powered melee kills while charged with light.
4. [Protective Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523075120/protective-light/) will use your stacks of light to save your butt if your health gets too low.
5. With every melee, [Impact Induction](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3470562293/impact-induction/) gives you some grenade energy back for even more destruction.
