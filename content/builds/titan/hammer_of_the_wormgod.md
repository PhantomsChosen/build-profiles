## Overview
This build allows you to deal absurd damage with throwing hammers and make a ton of orbs for your teammates. It's extremely potent in most PvE content but a bit too high-risk for GMs.

### Subclass:
[Code of the Devastator](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Devastator)

### Stat Requirements
Recovery is high priority for this build but a good baseline of strength and discipline are nice to kickstart [Roaring Flames](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Roaring_Flames) and get your hammer back if you lose it.
``` 
Mobility   : -
Resilience : -
Recovery   : 90
Discipline : 50+
Intellect  : -
Strength   : 50+
```
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

### Armor
[Wormgod Caress](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1734844651/wormgod-caress/) will give you the highest possible damage output witha stacking buff. [Synthoceps](https://www.light.gg/db/items/241462142/synthoceps/) are not as powerful but provide a very consistent buff that's easier to manage.

### Armor Mods
These mods are all optional but they add a lot of utility and survivability and will maximize your efficiency.
* [Elemental charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3730619869/elemental-charge/)
* [Melee Wellmaker](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4213142382/melee-wellmaker/)
* [Striking Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1484685885/striking-light/) (arc)
* [Well of life](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2164090163/well-of-life/) (solar)
* [Protective Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523075120/protective-light/) (void)
* [Shotgun Ammo finder](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4148827738/shotgun-ammo-finder/) + [Shotgun Scavenger](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3836152936/shotgun-scavenger/)
* [Impact Induction](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3470562293/impact-induction/)

### Weapons
A shotgun with "One-Two Punch" and full choke is critical to this build. 
* [One Small Step](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1016668089?s=1047830412,106909392,3161816588,2679249093,758092021,0) is an easily-farmable kinetic option.
* World drops and focusing umbrals can also drop a good [The Deicide](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/217140611?s=1047830412,106909392,3161816588,2679249093,758092021,0) for your energy slot.
* Consider running a primary weapon with [Wellspring](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3592538738/wellspring/) if you end up losing your hammer a lot.

[Tractor Cannon](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3580904581/tractor-cannon/) will fill your heavy slot and let you stack its debuff with One-Two Punch for absurd damage.

### How It Works
Unless you lose your hammer, you'll be killing things exclusively with your throwing hammer and sometimes shotguns. 

With Roaring Flames, solar ability kills increase your solar ability damage (~3 stacks). Wormgods Caress will ramp up your melee damage with every melee kill (~5 stacks). While your melees alone will obliterate most things, you can amplify the damage by activating One-Two punch before the melee and even further by debuffing he enemy with tractor cannon. These all stack together to let you erase enemies from existence in a single blow.

Here's how the mods work together:
1. When you get a kill with your throwing hammer, [Melee Wellmaker](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4213142382/melee-wellmaker/) makes a solar well of light.
2. When you pick up the well, [Elemental charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3730619869/elemental-charge/) gives you 2x Charged with Light and [Well of life](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2164090163/well-of-life/) gives you steady health regen, even while taking damage.
3. [Striking Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1484685885/striking-light/) makes an orb of power for your allies on powered melee kills while charged with light.
4. [Protective Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523075120/protective-light/) will use your stacks of light to save your butt if your health gets too low.
5. To top it all off, with every melee hit, [Impact Induction](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3470562293/impact-induction/) reduces your grenade cooldown.
