# The Peacekeeper

## Description
PvP build using Peacekeepers with Dual-SMG. This is also an effective build to run with a single SMG and another weapon archetype like a sniper or scout rifle.  

## Subclass:
Class-neutral but pairs best with Juggernaut striker or a subclasses with a healing utility.

## Stat Priority
Tier 6 resilience and tier 9 recovery are generally the standard for survivability and regeneration time. Feel free to pump them up further if you feel like it.
``` 
Mobility   : Any
Resilience : 60
Recovery   : 90
Discipline : any
Intellect  : any
Strength   : any
```

## Exotic Gear
`Armor` - [Peacekeepers](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3539357319/peacekeepers/) are required for this build. They give a massive amount of benefits but only **while holding an SMG**. The benefits are as follows:
  * Instant ready speed for SMGs
  * Increased handling for all SMG
  * Autoloading holster for stowed SMGs
  * Increased sprint speed while holding an SMG
  * Increased mobility, which improves strafe speed along with jump speed/height (equal to 5 tiers of mobility).

`Weapon` - No specific exotic weapon is required for this build.

## Armor Mods
No specific armor mods are needed for this build so you can focus on getting your base stats situated and then look into adding some basic combat mods like [Taking Charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3632726238/taking-charge/) and [High Energy Fire](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3632726237/high-energy-fire/).

## Weapons
SMGs with high range and zoom are preferred for effectiveness at further ranges. 
* A well-rolled [Multimach CCX](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3717177717?s=663495154,3142289711,2450788523,591790007,2697220197,0) with high range is ideal for your kinetic slot. [Escape Velocity](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1786797708?s=663495154,3142289711,1866048759,706527188,2697220197,0) is a solid alternative.
* [Shayura's Wrath](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/4023807721?s=3250034553,3142289711,588594999,438098033,2697220197,3789184904) is a easily the best option for the energy slot with [Borrowed Time](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/875848769?s=3250034553,1885400500,2846385770,1890422124,2697220197,0) as another good choice. 

## How it works
This one is pretty straight-forward. Shoot things, move around quickly, and shoot more things. 

It promotes a pretty close-quarters and mobile playstyle, therefore benefitting from a subclass with more cqc/melee utility, like a Juggernaut striker. The mobility and sprint buff will also be helpful for disengaging or strafing in 1v1s.

Running daul-SMG's, you never have to reload again. Just swap every time you empty a mag and you'll never stop firing. This should make it easier to move from engagement to engagement.

The only issue you *may* run into with daul-SMGs is long range engagements. For larger maps, I'd recommend keeping a scout rifle or sniper on hand to pair with one of your SMGs.
