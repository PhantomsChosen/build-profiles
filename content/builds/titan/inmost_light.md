## Overview
This build allows you to power up your abilities and speed up their cooldown. With the right subclass, it's even viable in GMs.

### Subclass: 
This works with any subclass but there are two that offer more viability in tougher activities like Grandmaster ordeals and Master lost sectors:
* [Code of the Seigebreaker](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Siegebreaker) 
  * This one excels in add-clear situations.
* [Code of the Commander](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Commander) 
  * This is good for add-clear too but its detonators and super make it more useful for encounters with large enemy vehicles as well.


### Stat Requirements
Discipline will be the main focus but a good baseline of strength and resilience are nice to help keep abilities empowered on a steady rotation. Like everything, you'll still want some recovery as well.
``` 
Mobility   : -
Resilience : 50+
Recovery   : 80+
Discipline : 90+
Intellect  : -
Strength   : 50+
```
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

### Armor
[Heart of Inmost Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1341951177/heart-of-inmost-light/) will be the keystone of this build  This exotic is sub-class-neutral too, so you can use it with your preferred sub-class.

### Armor Mods
[Heart of Inmost Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1341951177/heart-of-inmost-light/) is strong enough on its own but there are some potent mod combinations that can push things even further:
* Kickstart mods:
  * [Grenade Kickstart](https://www.light.gg/db/items/47859594/grenade-kickstart/) (stasis arms)
  * [Melee Kickstart](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1371877916/melee-kickstart/) (stasis arms)
  * [Utility Kickstart](https://www.light.gg/db/items/445559589/utility-kickstart/) (stasis class item)
* Charged With Light mods:
  * [Charge Harvester](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2263321587) (void)
  * [Firepower](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3185435908) (solar)
* Elemental Well Mods (PvE only):
  * [Elemental Ordnance](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1824486242)
  * [Well of Ordnance](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4288515061) (solar)

### Weapons
Some good exotic ptions are [Travelers chosen](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1853180924/travelers-chosen/) for an even distribution of ability energy or [Monte Carlo](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4068264807/monte-carlo/) to get your melee back faster and give grant a large damage buff on melee kills.

For legendary weapons, you can maximize your ability regen with the [Demolitionist](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523296417/demolitionist/) and [Wellspring](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3592538738/wellspring/) perks.

## How It Works
This build is pretty straight forward: Use your abilities to buff other abilities and use all of them more often. Also, even if you dont *need* to use your barricade, cast it to keep empowering your other abilities.

Below are the combat loops for the recommended subclass paths.  

**Code of the Seigebreaker**
1. Cast your barricade and throw an empowered grenade.
2. Solar ability kills will create a sunspot.
3. Standing in the sunspot gives you a 20% damage buff and increases all ability regeneration speed. This stacks with the Empowering buff from Heart of Inmost Light getting your abilities back even faster.
4. Kills while you're in the sunspot and enemies that die in the sunspot can create additional sunspots so you can chain them to keep your abiltiies charging.

**Code of the Commander**
1. Cast your barricade then throw an empowered grenade.
2. Dealing void ability damage to an enemy attaches a detonator.
3. Dealing more damage to enemies with detonators attached will detonate an explosion.
4. Detonator explosions heal and give ability energy to you and your nearby allies, keeping you alive and letting you use abilities more often.
   * Voidwall is ideal for this because it hammers enemies with multiple ticks of damage, creating a flurry explosions.
   * **Tip**: Throw a voidwall under fallen walkers and cabal tanks. They have multiple "parts" that detonators can attach to, allowing for more explosions. :)
5. Repeat and enjoy.
