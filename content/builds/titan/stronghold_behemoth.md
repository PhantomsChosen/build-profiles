## Overview
If you're looking for a space-knight power fantasy to run in endgame content, you've come to the right place. This build lets you get up-close and personal with a sword, taking minimal damage and healing yourself in the process. It's extremely tanky but also lets you deal some serious damage.

### Subclass:
This build technically works with any subclass but [Behemoth](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Behemoth) will unlock it's full potential.

#### Aspects
* [Tectonic Harvest](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2031919264/tectonic-harvest/) will keep you fuled with shards for your overshield and charges of light. 
* [Diamond Lance](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3866705246/diamond-lance/) will give you an extra fragment slot and some long-range freezing potential. 
#### Fragments
* [Whisper of Rime](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2483898430) to get an overshield from shards.
* [Whisper of Chains](https://www.light.gg/db/items/537774540) to take less damage near stasis crystals.
* [Whisper of Conduction](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2483898429) to pull shards towards you.
* [Whisper of Shards](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3469412975) for grenade regen buff after breaking crystals.
* [Whisper of Torment](https://www.light.gg/db/items/537774541) to get grenade energy from taking and blocking damage.

### Stat Requirements
You'll want to prioritize discipline and recovery with good baseline of resilience. This will let you deploy glaciers and barricades more often to make more shards or recover as needed. Strength is a non-issue since you'll get a ton of melee regen from picking up shards.  

``` 
Mobility   : -
Resilience : 50+
Recovery   : 90+
Discipline : 90+
Intellect  : -
Strength   : -
```
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

### Armor
[Stronghold]([lightgg_link](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2240152949/stronghold/)) is the glue that holds this build together. It will heal you when you block and allow you to block indefinitely, without consuming sword ammo. This makes it easy to move from enemy to enemy safely.

### Armor Mods
  * [Elemental Charge](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3730619869/elemental-charge/)
  * [Elemental Shards](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1977242752/elemental-shards/) (stasis)
  * [Font of Might](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1740246051/font-of-might/) (Only if using a stasis weapon)
  * [Protective Light](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3523075120/protective-light/) (void)
  * [Charged Up](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3185435910/charged-up/) or [Supercharged](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4272180934/supercharged/) (solar)
    * For non-GM content, you can use [Lucent Blade](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2979815165/lucent-blade/) (arc) or [High Energy Fire](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3632726237/high-energy-fire/) to deal more damage.
* [Sword Ammo Finder](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1476367343/sword-ammo-finder/) x2 (helmet)
* [Sword Scavenger](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2034622599/sword-scavenger/) (legs)

### Weapons

An [Eyasluna](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/235827225?s=1926090095,1968497646,3108830275,124408337,384158423,984527513) with [Unrelenting](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3108830275/unrelenting/) and [Headstone](https://www.light.gg/db/items/124408337/headstone/) will really shine with this build. Headstone makes more crystals to give you more resistance, stasis shards, and grenade regen. Unrelenting will give you 80 health and kick off health regeneration after 3 kills with the weapon. **This includes kills from shattering the crystals you make with it.** Insane, I know. You're welcome.

[Lament](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3487253372/the-lament/) completes your survivability loop as it provides a free damage buff and heals you when using the revved up attacks.

For esier content, you can run a well-rolled [crown-splitter](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2782325302?s=1261178282,2349202967,2244851822,3016987351,3486498337,0). Counterattack (+20%) and flash counter (+50%) stack and can give you a massive damage buff if you learn the timing.

### How It Works

Essentially, you'll create and shatter your crystals before and during engagements to give yourself an overshield and charges of light. This lets you get up close and personal with your sword while taking minimal damage and healing yourself.

#### Entering an engagement:

1. Throw down a glacier grenade and deploy your barricade against them to shatter the crystals.
2. This will give you an overshield, multiple charges of light, increased grenade regeneration, and a stasis weapon damage boost.

#### Combat

1. Block with your sword while moving towards enemies to rev up Lament. When you block incoming damage, Stronghold will heal you and Whisper of Torment will return some grenade energy.
2. Once you get close enough, you can start wailing on your enemies. 
3. If you're attacking an enemy with a stomp or knock back attack (bosses, phalanxes, etc), you can block with your sword to avoid being launched into the air.
4. Throughout combat, make stasis crystals whenever you can to keep yourself charged with light and regenerate your overshield.
5. Repeat until everything is dead.
