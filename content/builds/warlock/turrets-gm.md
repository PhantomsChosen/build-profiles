## Overview
This loadout lets you drop stasis turrets constantly to lock down
roomfuls of ads.

### Subclass
Shadebinder
* Grenade: Duskfield
* Aspects
    * Bleak Watcher
    * Iceflare Bolts
* Fragments
    * Whisper of Refraction
    * Whisper of Chains
    * Whisper of Durance
    * Whisper of Rending

 Whisper of Torment can be switched in for grenade energy on damage

### Stat Requirements
``` 
Mobility   : -
Resilience : -
Recovery   : 100
Discipline : 100
Intellect  : -
Strength   : -
```
* If you can't max out both recovery and discipline, find the right
balance for you
* A "`-`" means the stat isn't a priority for the build.

## Exotic Gear
`Armor` - Eye of Another World

### Armor Mods
* Required
    * 3x Firepower
    * 2x Bomber
    * Stacks on Stacks
    * Taking Charge
* Options
    * Anything that gives you grenade energy, such as Innervation or Grenade Kickstart
    * Anything that gives you class energy, such as Bolstering Detonation

### Weapons
This is a grenade/well build, so you want perks that max out
ability uptime such as [Demolitionist and
Wellspring](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/find/?f=2,10(Combat%20Bow;Scout%20Rifle),28:0(3523296417!3592538738))

Masterwork your weapons, as you need orbs to become Charged With Light.

Traveler's Chosen is fun to use in lower level content.

## How It Works
* Combat Loop
    * Become Charged With Light
    * Charge & throw your grenade
        * Firepower will restore a large portion of your grenade energy
    * Drop a well
        * Bomber will restore most of the rest of your grenade energy
    * Repeat
