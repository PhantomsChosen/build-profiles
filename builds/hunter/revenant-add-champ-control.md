**Revenant Stasis Hunter - Ad Control and Champ Abuser**
PvE build for endgame content.

This build uses several season 15 artifact mods. Based on [plunderthabooty's video here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE-X29pL7KU>). Stareater Scales is recommended. Mod distribution is a suggested setup. Some mods could be equipped on different pieces of armor if needed.
- **Abilities**: Gambler's Dodge, Duskfield Grenade
- **Aspects**: Grim Harvest, Touch of Winter
- **Fragments**: Whispers of Rime, Durance, Chains, and Shards

**Artifact Mods from Wayfinder's Compass**
- **Column 2**: Hands On

- **Column 6**: Well of Potency, Thermoclastic Blooming

**Armor Mod Setup**
- **Helmet**: Hands On x2, Melee Wellmaker
- **Arms**: Thermoclastic Blooming, Fire and Ice
- **Chest**: Well of Potency
- **Legs**: Absolution x2, Elemental Light

**Ager's Scepter Variant**
Ager's Scepter with the catalyst can create a very powerful champ killing build as described in [plunderthabooty's video here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFSOxnK_5kQ>). Its the same build as above with the following changes:

- **Exotic Armor**: Assassin's Cowl
- **Statis Fragments**: Bonds, Chains, Conduction, Rime
- **Armor Mod**: Elemental Shards

**Armor Mods**
- **Helmet**: Trace Rifle Ammo Finder x2, Melee Wellmaker
- **Chest**: Trace Rifle reserves, Font of Might
- **Legs**: Orbs of restoration (stasis), Trace Rifle Ammo Finder, Elemental Shards (stasis)
- **Class**: Resonance Siphon, Thermoclastic Strike, Well of Potency

You should trade out any finder, reserve, or scavenger mods for defensive mods when needed!  Although this build provides a lot of protection, it might be necessary to swap in resist mods to help with surviving end game content.
